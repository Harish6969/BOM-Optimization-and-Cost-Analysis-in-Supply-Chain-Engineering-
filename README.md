BOM Optimization and Cost Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on the optimization of a Bill of Materials (BOM) for a complex product, aiming to reduce costs and improve assembly efficiency. Using tools like LINGO and Excel, the project evaluates make-or-buy decisions and assembly line layouts to enhance production planning, minimize costs, and boost profitability.

üìä Project Insights
The BOM Optimization and Cost Analysis project offers insights into:

BOM Structure: Detailed hierarchical breakdown of the final product into components and sub-components, along with their associated costs for both buying and making.
Cost Optimization: Utilization of LINGO to perform a cost analysis comparing in-house manufacturing with external purchases.
Make-or-Buy Decision Analysis: In-depth cost comparison of buying versus making components, leading to more economical production decisions.
Assembly Line Efficiency: Visualization and analysis of the assembly line layout to optimize production and ensure scalability.
üîß Tools & Technologies
LINGO Software: For conducting optimization analysis of production costs.
Microsoft Excel: Used for make-or-buy decision analysis.
